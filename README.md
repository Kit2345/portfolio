# portfolio

Hi. I'm Kit a former scientist working in academia/research mostly in the fields of cancer and Genomics. I'm now looking for Junior Software Roles after completing the School of Code bootcamp. This is my portfolio site so you can find out more about me, and see some of my personal projects I have been working on.
